# Intro
Random square is a simple game made with Next.js.

## How to play?
- Click on Roll the dice to get a specific number of moves
- Move using arrow keys
- You can't move to the opposite direction that you are moving
- When you go to an `X` square with no moves left, you need to go from the beginning
- If you react the `W` square with no moves left, you completed the map
- If you react the `S` square with some moves left, you have to move backwards.
